## Presentations

Remember to put yourself in the shoes of the person that you're presenting to. Not all audiences are the same -- or even going to view your presentation in the same way. Some are sent to stakeholders in advance; some are keynote speeches versus board meetings.

Adjust your presentation to the audience and environment, specifically addressing their concerns, with storytelling as a bonus.

Powerpoints are powerful for the visuals, so try to keep the text minimal and allow the visuals to convey what your words cannot. It's difficult for viewers to listen to you _and_ read.

If your audience seems tuned out or you can't tell how they're reacting, try to ask them a question, build engagement, or use their names to break any monotonous tone.

Presenting skills require practice. Take the time to explore local meetups that improve your speaking skills and take advantage of the opportunities to present within your Team Lead groups.

<br>

Despite our best efforts, sometimes things go wrong. How do you maintain your composure? It's always good to have a backup physical copy of your presentation to easily pivot in front of an audience. Also get the equipment that you need to present well in any environment. If your computer needs a dongle to hook up to a TV or HDMI cable, invest in it and bring it. If you are uncertain about power, bring an extension cord.

## Critiquing

Critiques can hurt sometimes but we all recognize that in the long run, it's helpful for your growth.

If you are a perfectionist, it's important to learn early on that everyone has constant room for exploration and innovation. High standards are great, but you can't be completely perfect. 

Consider how to present your work in a way that makes it easy to receive feedback. 

If you're receiving critique, consider the feedback's value to your vision before making adjustments based on each piece of feedback. Maintain a baseline for your decisions and ensure the tweaks that you make based on feedback align with your decision making. Filtering feedback to only implement the ones that make sense for your designs.

If you're giving critique, make sure to never critique the _person_ or their abilities. You should only focus on critiquing the _work_. Take the time to really consider your words to prevent the receiver being defensive or the critique sounding like a personal judgment.

While a common practice is to "sandwich" a critique between two compliments, this can detract focus from improving the work efficiently. Instead, try to get straight to the point but remove words like "I like" or "I dislike" -- go for verbiage such as, "This works well because" or "An improve might be ___ because it would ____". This removes the personal judgement element and gives rationale for each critique.

When working with forms, a common design choice is to have the place holder text of an input field to disappear when a user starts typing (i.e. username, password). But this can be difficult for a user if they forget what they were inputting. Think of a way to show this information above or below the input field to still give them that feedback.

It can also be tricky when using placeholder text with like an example email or something. Sometimes people will see text, assume they have already filled it out, and completely ignore the field. So you do want to be super careful when you use placeholders.

An example of how to execute this can be seen [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/79247641/sign-up-form).

<br>

Always ask yourself if your design takes away from the user experience by making a task _more_ difficult to achieve cognitively. While minimalistic design is popular and we often say "Less is more," there is still the user experience to consider by placing ourselves in their shoes.

If you can take something away and the design/idea/purpose is going to be communicated as well - or even better - then it might not belong.

Keep in mind build efficiency as well. If your design adds significant build complexity for the developer (or creator), but doesn't add just as much improvement for the user's experience, it might not be a valuable tradeoff, depending on time and resources.

## Improve Your Vocabulary

To help you in your writing and presenting skills, here's an overview of words to remove from your vocabulary to become a more precise communicator:

<br>

`That` —> Replace with who or simply remove

`Went` —> Drove, skated, walked, flew, ran, etc.

`Honestly` —> Just remove it. It implies whatever else you’ve said was dishonest

`Absolutely/Surely` —> Usually redundant

`Very/Really` —> A magnifier, instead use the magnified word. Very happy? Ecstatic. Very sad? Melancholy or depressed

`Amazing/Awesome/Great` —> Try wonderful, incredible, startling, marvelous, astonishing, astounding, remarkable, miraculous, surprising, mind-blowing, staggering…

`Always/Never` —> An absolute, and how often is anything absolutely true?

`Literally` —> Most often used when one means “figuratively”. If you’re using literally, it should be to describe something isn’t being exaggerated….at all.

`Just` —> Filler word that can be condescending without value. It minimizes our or others’ value.

`Maybe/If` —> Lessens your authority, conveys uncertainty, sounds uninformed or wishy-washy.

`Stuff/Things` —> This is solely a placeholder for something better.

`Irregardless` —> Literally means regardless. :wink:

`Like` —> Are you a Valley Girl? No? Nix it.

`Should` —> Denotes opinion, often negative judgment.

`Problem` —> Instead it's a challenge. New word, less stress.

`But` —> Negates what was previously said. Try to rephrase using “and”

`Try` —> Be authoritative with your word and protect its value. Will you or won’t you? Best to underpromise and overdeliver.

`Basically/Essentially/Actually/Totally` —> Words we use to simplify but actually are empty filler
