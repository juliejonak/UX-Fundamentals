# Welcome to UX

Why do we design things a certain way -- cups, keyboards, doors? As user experience designers, we're involved in the process of designing everything, by considering how users act already, how we can change how they behave and what they need.

The pursuit of these goals can be applied to any field, because the thought process behind user focused design is similar across products.

UX covers the users interaction with a company and its products. We consider each touch point with the user from end to end, not just in one instance or with one product. Our job is to identify areas where the user's experience is sub-par and improving it with research and ideation.

We focus on translating the answers to the who, what, and why of product design and users into solutions for solving pain points. UX covers many aspects but the main focus is the end-to-end user experience.

Why does UX matter?

Nobody wants to use poorly designed products. Poor UX can cause frustration, while great UX might be something that brings a user joy, or they barely notices.

While the experience can be positive, negative or neutral, we focus on the experience and building solutions to improve the experience.

What is a UX designer?

There's a lot of ambiguity in design -- who is the user? What are the challenges? Designers conduct research to answer those questions and catalog information carefully to inform our designs. Testing is a integral part of the process.

The designer connects the dots between why something happens and how to change it. They have great attention to detail, while maintaining a bigger picture view. Design principles are guiding ideas that designers start with and grow their ideas from, not hard and fast rules.

It's important to have a user first mindset, placing their concerns at the forefront during product development. It's easy to have self-centered or profit-centered design over human-centered design. 

Often, ask yourself, "Why did you choose to do _this_?" This addresses our own bias in design and points to whether or not the decisions are backed by user research.

We also have to consider the factors that motivate our users by using empathy -- how are the users motivated? What are they feeling during the product experience?

Where and how you show information matters. Visuals can convey information to the user throughout any process to alleviate frustration. While empathy can be uncomfortable to share in a poor user experience, it's important to allow us to create improved experiences in significant areas.

The first stage of all UX design is Discovery: What do I know or not know? What am I going to be creating? What research exists on this topic? 

After that, you can Ideate and Prototype.
